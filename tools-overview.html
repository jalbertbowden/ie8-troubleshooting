Compatibility Issues from the Internet Explorer Team</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Internet Explorer 8 introduces many new features and
capabilities, such as Accelerators and Web Slices for Web developers to build
powerful customer experiences. Along
with those new features, Internet Explorer 8 includes an entirely new standards
based rendering and layout engine. In
addition, a new, faster JScript engine was added to Internet Explorer 8.
 While this new platform provides Web
developers the ability to write to standards and have their code work in all
major browsers, the changes can cause issues with previous Internet Explorer
versions that are still in use today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The focus of this document is to provide a few real world
examples (without site or company attribution) of issues the Internet Explorer
team has run into helping customers fix issues with their Web sites. Instead of
simply providing best practice guidance (code to standards!) or a list of
issues to avoid, this document is designed to give you an understanding of the
process the Internet Explorer team themselves use internally at Microsoft to
troubleshoot and resolve application compatibility issues, both for customer
Web sites and internet line of business applications.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc236665882">Tools Overview</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Throughout this document, we will use a set of tools to help
simplify the debugging process. Below is a quick overview of some of the tools.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc236665883">Developer Tools</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Internet Explorer 8 comes equipped with a set of developer
tools which empower you to quickly inspect your sites HTML, Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, and Document Object Model (DOM) tree as they exist in
Internet Explorer. This is especially helpful when debugging dynamic sites such
as those which utilize frameworks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Accessing the developer tools is simple: 
press F12 while viewing a page or select 
Developer Tools</b> from the 
Tools</b> menu.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc236665884">Web SuperPreview &amp; Windows Virtual PCs</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Web SuperPreview is a visual debugging tool which helps you
migrate web sites from earlier versions of Internet Explorer. Through the use
of side by side comparisons or an onion-skin overlay, you can quickly identify
differences in a layout rendered in various versions of Internet Explorer by
using rulers, guides, and zoom/pan tools. You can obtain Web SuperPreview at
the <a

Download Center</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alternatively, Windows Virtual PCs can be used to emulate
different environments within Windows. Using multiple Windows Virtual PCs, you
can view side by side how a website is rendered within Windows XP, Vista, or
other installations running Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 without the use of
multiple machines. Visit the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx">Windows Virtual
PC website</a> to obtain a copy. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc236665885">Fiddler</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fiddler is a useful tool often used by the Internet Explorer
team which captures traffic between the Internet and your computer. It allows
for inspection of both incoming and outgoing data and can be used to monitor
and fiddle with requests and responses before they are received by the
browser. Built by a Microsoft developer, Fiddler includes a powerful event-based
scripting subsystem and can be extended using any .NET language. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fiddler is available for free as an <a

Explorer add-on</a>.</p>
