            <h1><a id="learn">Learn to Troubleshoot Internet Explorer 8 Compatibility Issues from the Internet Explorer Team</a></h1>
            <p>Internet Explorer 8 introduces many new features and capabilities, such as Accelerators and Web Slices for Web developers to build powerful customer experiences. Along with those new features, Internet Explorer 8 includes an entirely new standards based rendering and layout engine. In addition, a new, faster JScript engine was added to Internet Explorer 8. While this new platform provides Web developers the ability to write to standards and have their code work in all major browsers, the changes can cause issues with previous Internet Explorer versions that are still in use today.</p>
            <p>The focus of this document is to provide a few real world examples (without site or company attribution) of issues the Internet Explorer team has run into helping customers fix issues with their Web sites. Instead of simply providing best practice guidance (code to standards!) or a list of issues to avoid, this document is designed to give you an understanding of the process the Internet Explorer team themselves use internally at Microsoft to troubleshoot and resolve application compatibility issues, both for customer Web sites and internet line of business applications.</p>
            <h1><a id="toolsoverview">Tools Overview</a></h1>
            <p>Throughout this document, we will use a set of tools to help simplify the debugging process. Below is a quick overview of some of the tools.</p>
            <h2><a id="devtools">Developer Tools</a></h2>
            <p>Internet Explorer 8 comes equipped with a set of developer tools which empower you to quickly inspect your sites HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, and Document Object Model (DOM) tree as they exist in Internet Explorer. This is especially helpful when debugging dynamic sites such as those which utilize frameworks.</p>
            <p>Accessing the developer tools is simple: press F12 while viewing a page or select Developer Tools> from the Tools> menu.</p>
            <h2><a id="websuperpreview">Web SuperPreview &amp; Windows Virtual PCs</a></h2>
            <p>Web SuperPreview is a visual debugging tool which helps you migrate web sites from earlier versions of Internet Explorer. Through the use of side by side comparisons or an onion-skin overlay, you can quickly identify differences in a layout rendered in various versions of Internet Explorer by using rulers, guides, and zoom/pan tools. You can obtain Web SuperPreview at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=8e6ac106-525d-45d0-84db-dccff3fae677">Microsoft Download Center</a>.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, Windows Virtual PCs can be used to emulate different environments within Windows. Using multiple Windows Virtual PCs, you can view side by side how a website is rendered within Windows XP, Vista, or other installations running Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 without the use of multiple machines. Visit the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx">Windows Virtual PC website</a> to obtain a copy. </p>
            <h2><a id="fiddler">Fiddler</a></h2>
            <p>Fiddler is a useful tool often used by the Internet Explorer team which captures traffic between the Internet and your computer. It allows for inspection of both incoming and outgoing data and can be used to monitor and fiddle with requests and responses before they are received by the browser. Built by a Microsoft developer, Fiddler includes a powerful event-based scripting subsystem and can be extended using any .NET language.</p>
            <p>Fiddler is available for free as an <a href="http://www.ieaddons.com/en/details/other/Microsoft_Fiddler/">Internet Explorer add-on</a>.</p>
